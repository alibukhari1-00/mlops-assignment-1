Step-by-Step Instructions to Run MLOps Assignment Code

1. Clone the GitHub Repository:
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd mlops-assignment-1
   (Replace <your-repo-url> with your GitHub link)

2. Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment:
   # Windows PowerShell
   python -m venv mlenv
   & mlenv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

   # Command Prompt (cmd)
   python -m venv mlenv
   mlenv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # Linux/Mac
   python3 -m venv mlenv
   source mlenv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Train Models and Log Metrics with MLflow:
   cd src
   python mlflowtrain.py
   # This trains Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models,
   # evaluates them, saves models in 'models/' folder,
   # saves metrics and confusion matrices in 'results/' folder,
   # and logs everything to MLflow under 'mlruns/'.

5. Launch MLflow UI:
   mlflow ui
   # Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:5000
   # Select experiment: 'mlops_assignment_1_experiment'
   # View metrics, runs, and artifacts (like confusion matrices)

6. Register Best Model in MLflow:
   python mlflowregistration.py
   # This selects the best model (based on F1-score) and registers it in MLflow Model Registry
   # Check MLflow UI under 'Models' to see registered model and version

7. Check Results:
   # All models are in 'models/' folder
   # Comparison results and confusion matrices are in 'results/' folder
   # MLflow logs are in 'mlruns/' folder
